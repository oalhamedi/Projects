- We will be looking at fair market rent values calculated by the US Housing and Urban Development Department.
 This data is used to calculate guidelines for several federal programs.
 The actual values for rents vary greatly across the US.

- Comparing styles
plot the same data in two different styles in order to see how the styles change the output.

- Removing spines
remove the lines on the top, bottom, left and right axis, which are often called spines.

- Look at the impact of two different palettes on the same distplot. 

- Creating Custom Palettes.

- Using matplotlib axes
the US HUD data is loaded in the dataframe df and all libraries are imported.

- Additional plot customizations.

- Adding annotations
annotate our distribution plot to include lines that show the mean and median rent prices.

- Multiple plots
plot a comparison of the fair market rents for 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom apartments.
