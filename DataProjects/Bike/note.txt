- Building a JointGrid and jointplot
look at the relationship between humidity levels and total rentals to see
 if there is an interesting relationship we might want to explore later.

- Jointplots and regression
Since the previous plot does not show a relationship between humidity and rental amounts,
we can look at another variable that we reviewed earlier.
Specifically, the relationship between temp and total_rentals.

- Complex jointplots
look at the different distributions for riders that are considered casual versus those that are registered.
