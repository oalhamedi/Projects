- We'll explore Seaborn's mpg dataset, which contains one row per car model and includes information
 such as the year the car was made, the number of miles per gallon ("M.P.G.") it achieves,
 the power of its engine (measured in "horsepower"), and its country of origin.

- What is the relationship between the power of a car's engine ("horsepower") and its fuel efficiency ("mpg")?
And how does this relationship vary by the number of cylinders ("cylinders") the car has? Let's find out.

- Exploring Seaborn's mpg dataset by looking at the relationship between how fast a car can accelerate ("acceleration")
and its fuel efficiency ("mpg"). Do these properties vary by country of origin ("origin")?

- We'll continue to explore Seaborn's mpg dataset, which contains one row per car model and includes information
 such as the year the car was made, its fuel efficiency (measured in "miles per gallon" or "M.P.G"),
 and its country of origin (USA, Europe, or Japan).

- How has the average miles per gallon achieved by these cars changed over time?
Let's use line plots to find out!

- Visualize how the distribution of miles per gallon has changed over time.

- How has the average horsepower for cars changed over time? And does this trend differ by country of origin?

- The relationship between a car's weight and its horsepower.

- Adding a title to a FacetGrid object.

- Adding a title and axis labels.

- We'll continue looking at the miles per gallon dataset.
 In the code provided, we create a point plot that displays
 the average acceleration for cars in each of the three places of origin.
