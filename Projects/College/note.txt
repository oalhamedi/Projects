- Look at some details from the US Department of Education on 4 year
 college tuition information and see if there are any interesting insights
 into which variables might help predict tuition costs.

- Look at the relationship between tuition and the percent of students
 that receive Pell grants. A Pell grant is based on student financial
 need and subsidized by the US Government. In this data set,
 each University has some percentage of students that receive these grants.

- Look at the relationship between tuition and the Undergraduate population
 abbreviated as UG in this data. We will start by looking at a scatter plot
 of the data and examining the impact of different bin sizes on the visualization. 

- Building a FacetGrid

- Using a factorplot
recreate one of the plots from the previous exercise using factorplot()
and show how to create a boxplot on a data-aware grid.

- Using a lmplot
For the first set of exercises, we will look at the Undergraduate population (UG)
 and compare it to the percentage of students receiving Pell Grants (PCTPELL).

For the second lmplot exercise, we can look at the relationships between
Average SAT scores and Tuition across the different degree types and public vs. non-profit schools.
